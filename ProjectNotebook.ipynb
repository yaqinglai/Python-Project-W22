    "\n",
    "##### This handbook has three main features: (1)recording new flowers added by user, (2)removing flowers unwanted by user, and (3)letting the user choose a flower to plant based on the collection of flowers in the handbook. Each flower is recorded as the name it's commonly referred to. Associated with each flower name is information related to its genus, color and season that it best grows. \n",
    "\n",
    "##### That said, if you feel like planting today, you could pull up a list of matching flowers after filtering for the genus, color or season. If you have no idea and just want to get planting, feel free to view the flower encyclopedia in the handbook. The encyclopedia displays the whole collection of flowers as well as all its related information! \n",
    "\n",
    "##### There is already a pre-existing library of flowers that the Garden Fairy left in there! Now, the Ultimate Secret Garden Handbook is in your hands. Feel free to interact with it. Make sure you make full use of it and get planting! "

Aside from the extremly useful skills that I'm taught in class (eg. loops, pandas, test functions, docstrings, etc.), I've also applied countless knowledge I've gained on the internet in my project to achieve the goal I set up when I started the project. From this project, I've learned that all emojis have a unicode or CLDR short name that we could easily use to print it out in python, and that we can't delete an item in a dictionary by simply using a typical for loop. Yet, most of all, I've learned how to intergrate all my codes to make sure they work cohesively to execute my project!"
